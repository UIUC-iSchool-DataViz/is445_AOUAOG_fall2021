       "\"\\nACT I\\nSCENE I. Venice. A street.\\nEnter RODERIGO and IAGO\\nRODERIGO\\nTush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly\\nThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse\\nAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\\nIAGO\\n'Sblood, but you will not hear me:\\nIf ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.\\nRODERIGO\\nThou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.\\nIAGO\\nDespise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,\\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\\nOff-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,\\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place:\\nBut he; as loving his own pride and purposes,\\nEvades them, with a bombast circumstance\\nHorribly stuff'd with epithets of war;\\nAnd, in conclusion,\\nNonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,\\n'I have already chose my officer.'\\nAnd what was he?\\nForsooth, a great arithmetician,\\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\\nA fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;\\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\\nNor the division of a battle knows\\nMore than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,\\nWherein the toged consuls can propose\\nAs masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,\\nIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:\\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds\\nChristian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd\\nBy debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,\\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\\nAnd I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.\\nRODERIGO\\nBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\\nIAGO\\nWhy, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,\\nPreferment goes by letter and affection,\\nAnd not by old gradation, where each second\\nStood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,\\nWhether I in any just term am affined\\nTo love the Moor.\\nRODERIGO\\nI would not follow him then.\\nIAGO\\nO, sir, content you;\\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him:\\nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\\nCannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark\\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave,\\nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\\nWears out his time, much like his master's ass,\\nFor nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:\\nWhip me such honest knaves. Others there are\\nWho, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,\\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\\nAnd, throwing but shows of service on their lords,\\nDo well thrive by them and when they have lined\\ntheir coats\\nDo themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;\\nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\\nWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\\nIn following him, I follow but myself;\\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\\nBut seeming so, for my peculiar end:\\nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\\nThe native act and figure of my heart\\nIn compliment extern, 'tis not long after\\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\\nFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.\\nRODERIGO\\nWhat a full fortune does the thicklips owe\\nIf he can carry't thus!\\nIAGO\\nCall up her father,\\nRouse him: make after him, poison his delight,\\nProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\\nAnd, though he in a fertile climate dwell,\\nPlague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\\nYet throw such changes of vexation on't,\\nAs it may lose some colour.\\nRODERIGO\\nHere is her father's house; I'll call aloud.\\nIAGO\\nDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\\nAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\\nIs spied in populous cities.\\nRODERIGO\\nWhat, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!\\nIAGO\\nAwake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!\\nLook to your house, your daughter and your bags!\\nThieves! thieves!\\nBRABANTIO appears above, at a window\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nWhat is the reason of this terrible summons?\\nWhat is the matter there?\\nRODERIGO\\nSignior, is all your family within?\\nIAGO\\nAre your doors lock'd?\\nBRABANTIO\\nWhy, wherefore ask you this?\\nIAGO\\n'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on\\nyour gown;\\nYour heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;\\nEven now, now, very now, an old black ram\\nIs topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;\\nAwake the snorting citizens with the bell,\\nOr else the devil will make a grandsire of you:\\nArise, I say.\\nBRABANTIO\\nWhat, have you lost your wits?\\nRODERIGO\\nMost reverend signior, do you know my voice?\\nBRABANTIO\\nNot I what are you?\\nRODERIGO\\nMy name is Roderigo.\\nBRABANTIO\\nThe worser welcome:\\nI have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:\\nIn honest plainness thou hast heard me say\\nMy daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,\\nBeing full of supper and distempering draughts,\\nUpon malicious bravery, dost thou come\\nTo start my quiet.\\nRODERIGO\\nSir, sir, sir,--\\nBRABANTIO\\nBut thou must needs be sure\\nMy spirit and my place have in them power\\nTo make this bitter to thee.\\nRODERIGO\\nPatience, good sir.\\nBRABANTIO\\nWhat tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;\\nMy house is not a grange.\\nRODERIGO\\nMost grave Brabantio,\\nIn simple and pure soul I come to you.\\nIAGO\\n'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not\\nserve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to\\ndo you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll\\nhave your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;\\nyou'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have\\ncoursers for cousins and gennets for germans.\\nBRABANTIO\\nWhat profane wretch art thou?\\nIAGO\\nI am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter\\nand the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.\\nBRABANTIO\\nThou art a villain.\\nIAGO\\nYou are--a senator.\\nBRABANTIO\\nThis thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.\\nRODERIGO\\nSir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,\\nIf't be your pleasure and most wise consent,\\nAs partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,\\nAt this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,\\nTransported, with no worse nor better guard\\nBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,\\nTo the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--\\nIf this be known to you and your allowance,\\nWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;\\nBut if you know not this, my manners tell me\\nWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe\\nThat, from the sense of all civility,\\nI thus would play and trifle with your reverence:\\nYour daughter, if you have not given her leave,\\nI say again, hath made a gross revolt;\\nTying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes\\nIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger\\nOf here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:\\nIf she be in her chamber or your house,\\nLet loose on me the justice of the state\\nFor thus deluding you.\\nBRABANTIO\\nStrike on the tinder, ho!\\nGive me a taper! call up all my people!\\nThis accident is not unlike my dream:\\nBelief of it oppresses me already.\\nLight, I say! light!\\nExit above\\n\\nIAGO\\nFarewell; for I must leave you:\\nIt seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,\\nTo be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--\\nAgainst the Moor: for, I do know, the state,\\nHowever this may gall him with some cheque,\\nCannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd\\nWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,\\nWhich even now stand in act, that, for their souls,\\nAnother of his fathom they have none,\\nTo lead their business: in which regard,\\nThough I do hate him as I do hell-pains.\\nYet, for necessity of present life,\\nI must show out a flag and sign of love,\\nWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,\\nLead to the Sagittary the raised search;\\nAnd there will I be with him. So, farewell.\\nExit\\n\\nEnter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches\\n\\nBRABANTIO\\nIt is too true an evil: gone she is;\\nAnd what's to come of my despised time\\nIs nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,\\nWhere didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!\\nWith the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!\\nHow didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me\\nPast thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:\\nRaise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?\\nRODERIGO\\nTruly, I think they are.\\nBRABANTIO\\nO heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!\\nFathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds\\nBy what you see them act. Is there not charms\\nBy which the property of youth and maidhood\\nMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,\\nOf some such thing?\\nRODERIGO\\nYes, sir, I have indeed.\\nBRABANTIO\\nCall up my brother. O, would you had had her!\\nSome one way, some another. Do you know\\nWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?\\nRODERIGO\\nI think I can discover him, if you please,\\nTo get good guard and go along with me.\\nBRABANTIO\\nPray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;\\nI may command at most. Get weapons, ho!\\nAnd raise some special officers of night.\\nOn, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.\\nExeunt\\n\\nSCENE II. Another street.\\nEnter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches\\nIAGO\\nThough in the trade of war I have slain men,\\nYet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience\\nTo do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity\\nSometimes to do me service: nine or ten times\\nI had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.\\nOTHELLO\\n'Tis better as it is.\\nIAGO\\nNay, but he prated,\\nAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\\nAgainst your honour\\nThat, with the little godliness I have,\\nI did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,\\nAre you fast married? Be assured of this,\\nThat the magnifico is much beloved,\\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\\nAs double as the duke's: he will divorce you;\\nOr put upon you what restraint and grievance\\nThe law, with all his might to enforce it on,\\nWill give him cable.\\nOTHELLO\\nLet him do his spite:\\nMy services which I have done the signiory\\nShall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--\\nWhich, when I know that boasting is an honour,\\nI shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being\\nFrom men of royal siege, and my demerits\\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\\nAs this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,\\nBut that I love the gentle Desdemona,\\nI would not my unhoused free condition\\nPut into circumscription and confine\\nFor the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?\\nIAGO\\nThose are the raised father and his friends:\\nYou were best go in.\\nOTHELLO\\nNot I I must be found:\\nMy parts, my title and my perfect soul\\nShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?\\nIAGO\\nBy Janus, I think no.\\nEnter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThe servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.\\nThe goodness of the night upon you, friends!\\nWhat is the news?\\nCASSIO\\nThe duke does greet you, general,\\nAnd he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,\\nEven on the instant.\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat is the matter, think you?\\nCASSIO\\nSomething from Cyprus as I may divine:\\nIt is a business of some heat: the galleys\\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\\nThis very night at one another's heels,\\nAnd many of the consuls, raised and met,\\nAre at the duke's already: you have been\\nhotly call'd for;\\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found,\\nThe senate hath sent about three several guests\\nTo search you out.\\nOTHELLO\\n'Tis well I am found by you.\\nI will but spend a word here in the house,\\nAnd go with you.\\nExit\\n\\nCASSIO\\nAncient, what makes he here?\\nIAGO\\n'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:\\nIf it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.\\nCASSIO\\nI do not understand.\\nIAGO\\nHe's married.\\nCASSIO\\nTo who?\\nRe-enter OTHELLO\\n\\nIAGO\\nMarry, to--Come, captain, will you go?\\nOTHELLO\\nHave with you.\\nCASSIO\\nHere comes another troop to seek for you.\\nIAGO\\nIt is Brabantio. General, be advised;\\nHe comes to bad intent.\\nEnter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHolla! stand there!\\nRODERIGO\\nSignior, it is the Moor.\\nBRABANTIO\\nDown with him, thief!\\nThey draw on both sides\\n\\nIAGO\\nYou, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.\\nOTHELLO\\nKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.\\nGood signior, you shall more command with years\\nThan with your weapons.\\nBRABANTIO\\nO thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?\\nDamn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;\\nFor I'll refer me to all things of sense,\\nIf she in chains of magic were not bound,\\nWhether a maid so tender, fair and happy,\\nSo opposite to marriage that she shunned\\nThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\\nWould ever have, to incur a general mock,\\nRun from her guardage to the sooty bosom\\nOf such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.\\nJudge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense\\nThat thou hast practised on her with foul charms,\\nAbused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals\\nThat weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;\\n'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.\\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee\\nFor an abuser of the world, a practiser\\nOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.\\nLay hold upon him: if he do resist,\\nSubdue him at his peril.\\nOTHELLO\\nHold your hands,\\nBoth you of my inclining, and the rest:\\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it\\nWithout a prompter. Where will you that I go\\nTo answer this your charge?\\nBRABANTIO\\nTo prison, till fit time\\nOf law and course of direct session\\nCall thee to answer.\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat if I do obey?\\nHow may the duke be therewith satisfied,\\nWhose messengers are here about my side,\\nUpon some present business of the state\\nTo bring me to him?\\nFirst Officer\\n'Tis true, most worthy signior;\\nThe duke's in council and your noble self,\\nI am sure, is sent for.\\nBRABANTIO\\nHow! the duke in council!\\nIn this time of the night! Bring him away:\\nMine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,\\nOr any of my brothers of the state,\\nCannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;\\nFor if such actions may have passage free,\\nBond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.\\nExeunt\\n\\nSCENE III. A council-chamber.\\nThe DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nThere is no composition in these news\\nThat gives them credit.\\nFirst Senator\\nIndeed, they are disproportion'd;\\nMy letters say a hundred and seven galleys.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nAnd mine, a hundred and forty.\\nSecond Senator\\nAnd mine, two hundred:\\nBut though they jump not on a just account,--\\nAs in these cases, where the aim reports,\\n'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm\\nA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nNay, it is possible enough to judgment:\\nI do not so secure me in the error,\\nBut the main article I do approve\\nIn fearful sense.\\nSailor\\n[Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!\\nFirst Officer\\nA messenger from the galleys.\\nEnter a Sailor\\n\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nNow, what's the business?\\nSailor\\nThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;\\nSo was I bid report here to the state\\nBy Signior Angelo.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nHow say you by this change?\\nFirst Senator\\nThis cannot be,\\nBy no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,\\nTo keep us in false gaze. When we consider\\nThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,\\nAnd let ourselves again but understand,\\nThat as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\\nSo may he with more facile question bear it,\\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace,\\nBut altogether lacks the abilities\\nThat Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,\\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskilful\\nTo leave that latest which concerns him first,\\nNeglecting an attempt of ease and gain,\\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nNay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.\\nFirst Officer\\nHere is more news.\\nEnter a Messenger\\n\\nMessenger\\nThe Ottomites, reverend and gracious,\\nSteering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,\\nHave there injointed them with an after fleet.\\nFirst Senator\\nAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?\\nMessenger\\nOf thirty sail: and now they do restem\\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearance\\nTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\\nYour trusty and most valiant servitor,\\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\\nAnd prays you to believe him.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\n'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.\\nMarcus Luccicos, is not he in town?\\nFirst Senator\\nHe's now in Florence.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nWrite from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.\\nFirst Senator\\nHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\\nEnter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers\\n\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nValiant Othello, we must straight employ you\\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.\\nTo BRABANTIO\\n\\nI did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;\\nWe lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.\\nBRABANTIO\\nSo did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;\\nNeither my place nor aught I heard of business\\nHath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care\\nTake hold on me, for my particular grief\\nIs of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature\\nThat it engluts and swallows other sorrows\\nAnd it is still itself.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nWhy, what's the matter?\\nBRABANTIO\\nMy daughter! O, my daughter!\\nDUKE OF VENICE Senator\\nDead?\\nBRABANTIO\\nAy, to me;\\nShe is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted\\nBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;\\nFor nature so preposterously to err,\\nBeing not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,\\nSans witchcraft could not.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nWhoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding\\nHath thus beguiled your daughter of herself\\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\\nYou shall yourself read in the bitter letter\\nAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper son\\nStood in your action.\\nBRABANTIO\\nHumbly I thank your grace.\\nHere is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,\\nYour special mandate for the state-affairs\\nHath hither brought.\\nDUKE OF VENICE Senator\\nWe are very sorry for't.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\n[To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this?\\nBRABANTIO\\nNothing, but this is so.\\nOTHELLO\\nMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,\\nMy very noble and approved good masters,\\nThat I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,\\nIt is most true; true, I have married her:\\nThe very head and front of my offending\\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\\nAnd little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:\\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,\\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have used\\nTheir dearest action in the tented field,\\nAnd little of this great world can I speak,\\nMore than pertains to feats of broil and battle,\\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause\\nIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,\\nI will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver\\nOf my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,\\nWhat conjuration and what mighty magic,\\nFor such proceeding I am charged withal,\\nI won his daughter.\\nBRABANTIO\\nA maiden never bold;\\nOf spirit so still and quiet, that her motion\\nBlush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,\\nOf years, of country, credit, every thing,\\nTo fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!\\nIt is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect\\nThat will confess perfection so could err\\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\\nTo find out practises of cunning hell,\\nWhy this should be. I therefore vouch again\\nThat with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,\\nOr with some dram conjured to this effect,\\nHe wrought upon her.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nTo vouch this, is no proof,\\nWithout more wider and more overt test\\nThan these thin habits and poor likelihoods\\nOf modern seeming do prefer against him.\\nFirst Senator\\nBut, Othello, speak:\\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\\nSubdue and poison this young maid's affections?\\nOr came it by request and such fair question\\nAs soul to soul affordeth?\\nOTHELLO\\nI do beseech you,\\nSend for the lady to the Sagittary,\\nAnd let her speak of me before her father:\\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\\nThe trust, the office I do hold of you,\\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\\nEven fall upon my life.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nFetch Desdemona hither.\\nOTHELLO\\nAncient, conduct them: you best know the place.\\nExeunt IAGO and Attendants\\n\\nAnd, till she come, as truly as to heaven\\nI do confess the vices of my blood,\\nSo justly to your grave ears I'll present\\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady's love,\\nAnd she in mine.\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nSay it, Othello.\\nOTHELLO\\nHer father loved me; oft invited me;\\nStill question'd me the story of my life,\\nFrom year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,\\nThat I have passed.\\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days,\\nTo the very moment that he bade me tell it;\\nWherein I spake of most disastrous chances,\\nOf moving accidents by flood and field\\nOf hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,\\nOf being taken by the insolent foe\\nAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thence\\nAnd portance in my travels' history:\\nWherein of antres vast and deserts idle,\\nRough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven\\nIt was my hint to speak,--such was the process;\\nAnd of the Cannibals that each other eat,\\nThe Anthropophagi and men whose heads\\nDo grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear\\nWould Desdemona seriously incline:\\nBut still the house-affairs would draw her thence:\\nWhich ever as she could with haste dispatch,\\nShe'ld come again, and with a greedy ear\\nDevour up my discourse: which I observing,\\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart\\nThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,\\nWhereof by parcels she had something heard,\\nBut not intentively: I did consent,\\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears,\\nWhen I did speak of some distressful stroke\\nThat my youth suffer'd. My story being done,\\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs:\\nShe swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,\\n'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:\\nShe wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd\\nThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,\\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,\\nI should but teach him how to tell my story.\\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:\\nShe loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,\\nAnd I loved her that she did pity them.\\nThis only is the witchcraft I have used:\\nHere comes the lady; let her witness it.\\nEnter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants\\n\\nDUKE OF VENICE\\nI think this tale would win my daughter too.\\nGood Brabantio,\\nTake up this mangled matter at the best:\\nMen do their broken weapons rather use\\nThan their bare hands.\\nBRABANTIO\\nI pray you, hear her speak:\\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\\nDestruction on my head, if my bad blame\\nLight on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:\\nDo you perceive in all this noble company\\nWhere most you owe obedience?\\nDESDEMONA\\nMy noble father,\\nI do perceive here a divided duty:\\nTo you I am bound for life and education;\\nMy life and education both do learn me\\nHow to respect you; you are the lord of duty;\\nI am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,\\nAnd so much duty as my mother show'd\\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\\nSo much I challenge that I may profess\\nDue to the Moor my lord.\\nBRABANTIO\\nGod be wi' you! I have done.\\nPlease it your grace, on to the state-affairs:\\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it.\\nCome hither, Moor:\\nI here do give thee that with all my heart\\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\\nI would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,\\nI am glad at soul I have no other child:\\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\\nTo hang clogs on them.

Why,\\nthou silly gentleman!\\nRODERIGO\\nIt is silliness to live when to live is torment; and\\nthen have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.\\nIAGO\\nO villainous! I have looked upon the world for four\\ntimes seven years; and since I could distinguish\\nbetwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man\\nthat knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I\\nwould drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I\\nwould change my humanity with a baboon.\\nRODERIGO\\nWhat should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so\\nfond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.\\nIAGO\\nVirtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus\\nor thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which\\nour wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant\\nnettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up\\nthyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or\\ndistract it with many, either to have it sterile\\nwith idleness, or manured with industry, why, the\\npower and corrigible authority of this lies in our\\nwills. If the balance of our lives had not one\\nscale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the\\nblood and baseness of our natures would conduct us\\nto most preposterous conclusions: but we have\\nreason to cool our raging motions, our carnal\\nstings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that\\nyou call love to be a sect or scion.\\nRODERIGO\\nIt cannot be.\\nIAGO\\nIt is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of\\nthe will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown\\ncats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy\\nfriend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with\\ncables of perdurable toughness; I could never\\nbetter stead thee than now. Put money in thy\\npurse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with\\nan usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It\\ncannot be that Desdemona should long continue her\\nlove to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he\\nhis to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou\\nshalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but\\nmoney in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in\\ntheir wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food\\nthat to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be\\nto him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must\\nchange for youth: when she is sated with his body,\\nshe will find the error of her choice: she must\\nhave change, she must: therefore put money in thy\\npurse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a\\nmore delicate way than drowning. Make all the money\\nthou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt\\nan erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not\\ntoo hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou\\nshalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of\\ndrowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek\\nthou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than\\nto be drowned and go without her.\\nRODERIGO\\nWilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on\\nthe issue?\\nIAGO\\nThou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told\\nthee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I\\nhate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no\\nless reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge\\nagainst him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost\\nthyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many\\nevents in the womb of time which will be delivered.\\nTraverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more\\nof this to-morrow. Adieu.\\nRODERIGO\\nWhere shall we meet i' the morning?\\nIAGO\\nAt my lodging.\\nRODERIGO\\nI'll be with thee betimes.\\nIAGO\\nGo to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?\\nRODERIGO\\nWhat say you?\\nIAGO\\nNo more of drowning, do you hear?\\nRODERIGO\\nI am changed: I'll go sell all my land.\\nExit\\n\\nIAGO\\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse:\\nFor I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,\\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe.\\nBut for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:\\nAnd it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets\\nHe has done my office: I know not if't be true;\\nBut I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\\nWill do as if for surety. He holds me well;\\nThe better shall my purpose work on him.\\nCassio's a proper man: let me see now:\\nTo get his place and to plume up my will\\nIn double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--\\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello's ear\\nThat he is too familiar with his wife.\\nHe hath a person and a smooth dispose\\nTo be suspected, framed to make women false.\\nThe Moor is of a free and open nature,\\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so,\\nAnd will as tenderly be led by the nose\\nAs asses are.\\nI have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night\\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.\\nExit\\n\\nACT II\\nSCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus.

There's one gone to the harbour?\\nIAGO\\nAy, madam.\\nDESDEMONA\\nI am not merry; but I do beguile\\nThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise.\\nCome, how wouldst thou praise me?\\nIAGO\\nI am about it; but indeed my invention\\nComes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;\\nIt plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,\\nAnd thus she is deliver'd.\\nIf she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,\\nThe one's for use, the other useth it.\\nDESDEMONA\\nWell praised!

Ay, smile upon\\nher, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.\\nYou say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as\\nthese strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had\\nbeen better you had not kissed your three fingers so\\noft, which now again you are most apt to play the\\nsir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent\\ncourtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers\\nto your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!\\nTrumpet within\\n\\nThe Moor!

O my soul's joy!\\nIf after every tempest come such calms,\\nMay the winds blow till they have waken'd death!\\nAnd let the labouring bark climb hills of seas\\nOlympus-high and duck again as low\\nAs hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,\\n'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,\\nMy soul hath her content so absolute\\nThat not another comfort like to this\\nSucceeds in unknown fate.\\nDESDEMONA\\nThe heavens forbid\\nBut that our loves and comforts should increase,\\nEven as our days do grow!\\nOTHELLO\\nAmen to that, sweet powers!\\nI cannot speak enough of this content;\\nIt stops me here; it is too much of joy:\\nAnd this, and this, the greatest discords be\\nKissing her\\n\\nThat e'er our hearts shall make!\\nIAGO\\n[Aside] O, you are well tuned now!\\nBut I'll set down the pegs that make this music,\\nAs honest as I am.\\nOTHELLO\\nCome, let us to the castle.\\nNews, friends; our wars are done, the Turks\\nare drown'd.\\nHow does my old acquaintance of this isle?\\nHoney, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;\\nI have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,\\nI prattle out of fashion, and I dote\\nIn mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,\\nGo to the bay and disembark my coffers:\\nBring thou the master to the citadel;\\nHe is a good one, and his worthiness\\nDoes challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,\\nOnce more, well met at Cyprus.\\nExeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants\\n\\nIAGO\\nDo thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come\\nhither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base\\nmen being in love have then a nobility in their\\nnatures more than is native to them--list me. The\\nlieutenant tonight watches on the court of\\nguard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is\\ndirectly in love with him.\\nRODERIGO\\nWith him! why, 'tis not possible.\\nIAGO\\nLay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.\\nMark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,\\nbut for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:\\nand will she love him still for prating? let not\\nthy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;\\nand what delight shall she have to look on the\\ndevil? When the blood is made dull with the act of\\nsport, there should be, again to inflame it and to\\ngive satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,\\nsympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which\\nthe Moor is defective in: now, for want of these\\nrequired conveniences, her delicate tenderness will\\nfind itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,\\ndisrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will\\ninstruct her in it and compel her to some second\\nchoice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most\\npregnant and unforced position--who stands so\\neminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio\\ndoes? a knave very voluble; no further\\nconscionable than in putting on the mere form of\\ncivil and humane seeming, for the better compassing\\nof his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,\\nnone; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a\\nfinder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and\\ncounterfeit advantages, though true advantage never\\npresent itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the\\nknave is handsome, young, and hath all those\\nrequisites in him that folly and green minds look\\nafter: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman\\nhath found him already.\\nRODERIGO\\nI cannot believe that in her; she's full of\\nmost blessed condition.\\nIAGO\\nBlessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of\\ngrapes: if she had been blessed, she would never\\nhave loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou\\nnot see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst\\nnot mark that?\\nRODERIGO\\nYes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.\\nIAGO\\nLechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue\\nto the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met\\nso near with their lips that their breaths embraced\\ntogether. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these\\nmutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes\\nthe master and main exercise, the incorporate\\nconclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I\\nhave brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;\\nfor the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows\\nyou not. I'll not be far from you: do you find\\nsome occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking\\ntoo loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what\\nother course you please, which the time shall more\\nfavourably minister.\\nRODERIGO\\nWell.\\nIAGO\\nSir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply\\nmay strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for\\neven out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to\\nmutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true\\ntaste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So\\nshall you have a shorter journey to your desires by\\nthe means I shall then have to prefer them; and the\\nimpediment most profitably removed, without the\\nwhich there were no expectation of our prosperity.\\nRODERIGO\\nI will do this, if I can bring it to any\\nopportunity.\\nIAGO\\nI warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:\\nI must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.\\nRODERIGO\\nAdieu.\\nExit\\n\\nIAGO\\nThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;\\nThat she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:\\nThe Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,\\nIs of a constant, loving, noble nature,\\nAnd I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona\\nA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;\\nNot out of absolute lust, though peradventure\\nI stand accountant for as great a sin,\\nBut partly led to diet my revenge,\\nFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor\\nHath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof\\nDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;\\nAnd nothing can or shall content my soul\\nTill I am even'd with him, wife for wife,\\nOr failing so, yet that I put the Moor\\nAt least into a jealousy so strong\\nThat judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,\\nIf this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash\\nFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,\\nI'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,\\nAbuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--\\nFor I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--\\nMake the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.\\nFor making him egregiously an ass\\nAnd practising upon his peace and quiet\\nEven to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:\\nKnavery's plain face is never seen tin used.\\nExit\\n\\nSCENE II. A street.\\nEnter a Herald with a proclamation; People following\\nHerald\\nIt is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant\\ngeneral, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,\\nimporting the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,\\nevery man put himself into triumph; some to dance,\\nsome to make bonfires, each man to what sport and\\nrevels his addiction leads him: for, besides these\\nbeneficial news, it is the celebration of his\\nnuptial. So much was his pleasure should be\\nproclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full\\nliberty of feasting from this present hour of five\\ntill the bell have told eleven.

Our general cast us thus early for the love\\nof his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:\\nhe hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and\\nshe is sport for Jove.\\nCASSIO\\nShe's a most exquisite lady.\\nIAGO\\nAnd, I'll warrant her, fun of game.\\nCASSIO\\nIndeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.\\nIAGO\\nWhat an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of\\nprovocation.\\nCASSIO\\nAn inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.\\nIAGO\\nAnd when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?\\nCASSIO\\nShe is indeed perfection.\\nIAGO\\nWell, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I\\nhave a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace\\nof Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to\\nthe health of black Othello.\\nCASSIO\\nNot to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and\\nunhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish\\ncourtesy would invent some other custom of\\nentertainment.\\nIAGO\\nO, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for\\nyou.\\nCASSIO\\nI have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was\\ncraftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation\\nit makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,\\nand dare not task my weakness with any more.\\nIAGO\\nWhat, man!

Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,\\nAm I to put our Cassio in some action\\nThat may offend the isle.--But here they come:\\nIf consequence do but approve my dream,\\nMy boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.\\nRe-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine\\n\\nCASSIO\\n'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.\\nMONTANO\\nGood faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am\\na soldier.\\nIAGO\\nSome wine, ho!\\nSings\\n\\nAnd let me the canakin clink, clink;\\nAnd let me the canakin clink\\nA soldier's a man;\\nA life's but a span;\\nWhy, then, let a soldier drink.\\nSome wine, boys!\\nCASSIO\\n'Fore God, an excellent song.\\nIAGO\\nI learned it in England, where, indeed, they are\\nmost potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and\\nyour swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing\\nto your English.\\nCASSIO\\nIs your Englishman so expert in his drinking?\\nIAGO\\nWhy, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead\\ndrunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he\\ngives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle\\ncan be filled.\\nCASSIO\\nTo the health of our general!\\nMONTANO\\nI am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.\\nIAGO\\nO sweet England!\\nKing Stephen was a worthy peer,\\nHis breeches cost him but a crown;\\nHe held them sixpence all too dear,\\nWith that he call'd the tailor lown.\\nHe was a wight of high renown,\\nAnd thou art but of low degree:\\n'Tis pride that pulls the country down;\\nThen take thine auld cloak about thee.\\nSome wine, ho!\\nCASSIO\\nWhy, this is a more exquisite song than the other.\\nIAGO\\nWill you hear't again?\\nCASSIO\\nNo; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that\\ndoes those things. Well, God's above all; and there\\nbe souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.\\nIAGO\\nIt's true, good lieutenant.\\nCASSIO\\nFor mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor\\nany man of quality,--I hope to be saved.\\nIAGO\\nAnd so do I too, lieutenant.\\nCASSIO\\nAy, but, by your leave, not before me; the\\nlieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's\\nhave no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive\\nus our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.\\nDo not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my\\nancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:\\nI am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and\\nspeak well enough.\\nAll\\nExcellent well.\\nCASSIO\\nWhy, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.\\nExit\\n\\nMONTANO\\nTo the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.\\nIAGO\\nYou see this fellow that is gone before;\\nHe is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar\\nAnd give direction: and do but see his vice;\\n'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,\\nThe one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.\\nI fear the trust Othello puts him in.\\nOn some odd time of his infirmity,\\nWill shake this island.\\nMONTANO\\nBut is he often thus?\\nIAGO\\n'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:\\nHe'll watch the horologe a double set,\\nIf drink rock not his cradle.\\nMONTANO\\nIt were well\\nThe general were put in mind of it.\\nPerhaps he sees it not; or his good nature\\nPrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,\\nAnd looks not on his evils: is not this true?\\nEnter RODERIGO\\n\\nIAGO\\n[Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!\\nI pray you, after the lieutenant; go.\\nExit RODERIGO\\n\\nMONTANO\\nAnd 'tis great pity that the noble Moor\\nShould hazard such a place as his own second\\nWith one of an ingraft infirmity:\\nIt were an honest action to say\\nSo to the Moor.\\nIAGO\\nNot I, for this fair island:\\nI do love Cassio well; and would do much\\nTo cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?\\nCry within: 'Help! help!'\\n\\nRe-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO\\n\\nCASSIO\\nYou rogue! you rascal!\\nMONTANO\\nWhat's the matter, lieutenant?\\nCASSIO\\nA knave teach me my duty!\\nI'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.\\nRODERIGO\\nBeat me!\\nCASSIO\\nDost thou prate, rogue?\\nStriking RODERIGO\\n\\nMONTANO\\nNay, good lieutenant;\\nStaying him\\n\\nI pray you, sir, hold your hand.\\nCASSIO\\nLet me go, sir,\\nOr I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.\\nMONTANO\\nCome, come,\\nyou're drunk.\\nCASSIO\\nDrunk!\\nThey fight\\n\\nIAGO\\n[Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.\\nExit RODERIGO\\n\\nNay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--\\nHelp, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;\\nHelp, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!\\nBell rings\\n\\nWho's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!\\nThe town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!\\nYou will be shamed for ever.\\nRe-enter OTHELLO and Attendants\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat is the matter here?\\nMONTANO\\n'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.\\nFaints\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nHold, for your lives!\\nIAGO\\nHold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--\\nHave you forgot all sense of place and duty?\\nHold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!\\nOTHELLO\\nWhy, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?\\nAre we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that\\nWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?\\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:\\nHe that stirs next to carve for his own rage\\nHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.\\nSilence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle\\nFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?\\nHonest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,\\nSpeak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.\\nIAGO\\nI do not know: friends all but now, even now,\\nIn quarter, and in terms like bride and groom\\nDevesting them for bed; and then, but now--\\nAs if some planet had unwitted men--\\nSwords out, and tilting one at other's breast,\\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\\nAny beginning to this peevish odds;\\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\\nThose legs that brought me to a part of it!\\nOTHELLO\\nHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?\\nCASSIO\\nI pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.\\nOTHELLO\\nWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil;\\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\\nThe world hath noted, and your name is great\\nIn mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,\\nThat you unlace your reputation thus\\nAnd spend your rich opinion for the name\\nOf a night-brawler? give me answer to it.\\nMONTANO\\nWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:\\nYour officer, Iago, can inform you,--\\nWhile I spare speech, which something now\\noffends me,--\\nOf all that I do know: nor know I aught\\nBy me that's said or done amiss this night;\\nUnless self-charity be sometimes a vice,\\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin\\nWhen violence assails us.\\nOTHELLO\\nNow, by heaven,\\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule;\\nAnd passion, having my best judgment collied,\\nAssays to lead the way: if I once stir,\\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you\\nShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know\\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on;\\nAnd he that is approved in this offence,\\nThough he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,\\nShall lose me. What! in a town of war,\\nYet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,\\nTo manage private and domestic quarrel,\\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety!\\n'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?\\nMONTANO\\nIf partially affined, or leagued in office,\\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\\nThou art no soldier.\\nIAGO\\nTouch me not so near:\\nI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth\\nThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio;\\nYet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth\\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.\\nMontano and myself being in speech,\\nThere comes a fellow crying out for help:\\nAnd Cassio following him with determined sword,\\nTo execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman\\nSteps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:\\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue,\\nLest by his clamour--as it so fell out--\\nThe town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,\\nOutran my purpose; and I return'd the rather\\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords,\\nAnd Cassio high in oath; which till to-night\\nI ne'er might say before. When I came back--\\nFor this was brief--I found them close together,\\nAt blow and thrust; even as again they were\\nWhen you yourself did part them.\\nMore of this matter cannot I report:\\nBut men are men; the best sometimes forget:\\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best,\\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, received\\nFrom him that fled some strange indignity,\\nWhich patience could not pass.\\nOTHELLO\\nI know, Iago,\\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\\nMaking it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee\\nBut never more be officer of mine.\\nRe-enter DESDEMONA, attended\\n\\nLook, if my gentle love be not raised up!\\nI'll make thee an example.\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhat's the matter?\\nOTHELLO\\nAll's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.\\nSir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:\\nLead him off.\\nTo MONTANO, who is led off\\n\\nIago, look with care about the town,\\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.\\nCome, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life\\nTo have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.\\nExeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO\\n\\nIAGO\\nWhat, are you hurt, lieutenant?\\nCASSIO\\nAy, past all surgery.\\nIAGO\\nMarry, heaven forbid!\\nCASSIO\\nReputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost\\nmy reputation! I have lost the immortal part of\\nmyself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,\\nIago, my reputation!\\nIAGO\\nAs I am an honest man, I thought you had received\\nsome bodily wound; there is more sense in that than\\nin reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false\\nimposition: oft got without merit, and lost without\\ndeserving: you have lost no reputation at all,\\nunless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!\\nthere are ways to recover the general again: you\\nare but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in\\npolicy than in malice, even so as one would beat his\\noffenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue\\nto him again, and he's yours.\\nCASSIO\\nI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so\\ngood a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so\\nindiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?\\nand squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse\\nfustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible\\nspirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,\\nlet us call thee devil!\\nIAGO\\nWhat was he that you followed with your sword? What\\nhad he done to you?\\nCASSIO\\nI know not.\\nIAGO\\nIs't possible?\\nCASSIO\\nI remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;\\na quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men\\nshould put an enemy in their mouths to steal away\\ntheir brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance\\nrevel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!\\nIAGO\\nWhy, but you are now well enough: how came you thus\\nrecovered?\\nCASSIO\\nIt hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place\\nto the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me\\nanother, to make me frankly despise myself.\\nIAGO\\nCome, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,\\nthe place, and the condition of this country\\nstands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;\\nbut, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.\\nCASSIO\\nI will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me\\nI am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,\\nsuch an answer would stop them all. To be now a\\nsensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a\\nbeast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is\\nunblessed and the ingredient is a devil.\\nIAGO\\nCome, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,\\nif it be well used: exclaim no more against it.\\nAnd, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.\\nCASSIO\\nI have well approved it, sir. I drunk!\\nIAGO\\nYou or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.\\nI'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife\\nis now the general: may say so in this respect, for\\nthat he hath devoted and given up himself to the\\ncontemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and\\ngraces: confess yourself freely to her; importune\\nher help to put you in your place again: she is of\\nso free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,\\nshe holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more\\nthan she is requested: this broken joint between\\nyou and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my\\nfortunes against any lay worth naming, this\\ncrack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.\\nCASSIO\\nYou advise me well.\\nIAGO\\nI protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\\nCASSIO\\nI think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will\\nbeseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:\\nI am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.\\nIAGO\\nYou are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I\\nmust to the watch.\\nCASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.\\nExit\\n\\nIAGO\\nAnd what's he then that says I play the villain?\\nWhen this advice is free I give and honest,\\nProbal to thinking and indeed the course\\nTo win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy\\nThe inclining Desdemona to subdue\\nIn any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful\\nAs the free elements. And then for her\\nTo win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,\\nAll seals and symbols of redeemed sin,\\nHis soul is so enfetter'd to her love,\\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\\nEven as her appetite shall play the god\\nWith his weak function. How am I then a villain\\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,\\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\\nWhen devils will the blackest sins put on,\\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows,\\nAs I do now: for whiles this honest fool\\nPlies Desdemona to repair his fortunes\\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\\nI'll pour this pestilence into his ear,\\nThat she repeals him for her body's lust;\\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor.\\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch,\\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\\nThat shall enmesh them all.\\nRe-enter RODERIGO\\n\\nHow now, Roderigo!\\nRODERIGO\\nI do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that\\nhunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is\\nalmost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well\\ncudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall\\nhave so much experience for my pains, and so, with\\nno money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.\\nIAGO\\nHow poor are they that have not patience!\\nWhat wound did ever heal but by degrees?\\nThou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;\\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\\nDoes't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.\\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:\\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\\nYet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:\\nContent thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;\\nPleasure and action make the hours seem short.\\nRetire thee; go where thou art billeted:\\nAway, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:\\nNay, get thee gone.\\nExit RODERIGO\\n\\nTwo things are to be done:\\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;\\nI'll set her on;\\nMyself the while to draw the Moor apart,\\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find\\nSoliciting his wife: ay, that's the way\\nDull not device by coldness and delay.\\nExit\\n\\nACT III\\nSCENE I.

There's a poor piece\\nof gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends\\nthe general's wife be stirring, tell her there's\\none Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:\\nwilt thou do this?\\nClown\\nShe is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I\\nshall seem to notify unto her.\\nCASSIO\\nDo, good my friend.\\nExit Clown\\n\\nEnter IAGO\\n\\nIn happy time, Iago.\\nIAGO\\nYou have not been a-bed, then?\\nCASSIO\\nWhy, no; the day had broke\\nBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,\\nTo send in to your wife: my suit to her\\nIs, that she will to virtuous Desdemona\\nProcure me some access.\\nIAGO\\nI'll send her to you presently;\\nAnd I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor\\nOut of the way, that your converse and business\\nMay be more free.\\nCASSIO\\nI humbly thank you for't.\\nExit IAGO\\n\\nI never knew\\nA Florentine more kind and honest.\\nEnter EMILIA\\n\\nEMILIA\\nGood morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry\\nFor your displeasure; but all will sure be well.\\nThe general and his wife are talking of it;\\nAnd she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,\\nThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,\\nAnd great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom\\nHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you\\nAnd needs no other suitor but his likings\\nTo take the safest occasion by the front\\nTo bring you in again.\\nCASSIO\\nYet, I beseech you,\\nIf you think fit, or that it may be done,\\nGive me advantage of some brief discourse\\nWith Desdemona alone.\\nEMILIA\\nPray you, come in;\\nI will bestow you where you shall have time\\nTo speak your bosom freely.\\nCASSIO\\nI am much bound to you.\\nExeunt\\n\\nSCENE II.

The garden of the castle.\\nEnter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA\\nDESDEMONA\\nBe thou assured, good Cassio, I will do\\nAll my abilities in thy behalf.\\nEMILIA\\nGood madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,\\nAs if the case were his.\\nDESDEMONA\\nO, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,\\nBut I will have my lord and you again\\nAs friendly as you were.\\nCASSIO\\nBounteous madam,\\nWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\\nHe's never any thing but your true servant.\\nDESDEMONA\\nI know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:\\nYou have known him long; and be you well assured\\nHe shall in strangeness stand no further off\\nThan in a polite distance.\\nCASSIO\\nAy, but, lady,\\nThat policy may either last so long,\\nOr feed upon such nice and waterish diet,\\nOr breed itself so out of circumstance,\\nThat, I being absent and my place supplied,\\nMy general will forget my love and service.\\nDESDEMONA\\nDo not doubt that; before Emilia here\\nI give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,\\nIf I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it\\nTo the last article: my lord shall never rest;\\nI'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;\\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\\nI'll intermingle every thing he does\\nWith Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;\\nFor thy solicitor shall rather die\\nThan give thy cause away.\\nEMILIA\\nMadam, here comes my lord.\\nCASSIO\\nMadam, I'll take my leave.\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy, stay, and hear me speak.\\nCASSIO\\nMadam, not now: I am very ill at ease,\\nUnfit for mine own purposes.\\nDESDEMONA\\nWell, do your discretion.\\nExit CASSIO\\n\\nEnter OTHELLO and IAGO\\n\\nIAGO\\nHa! I like not that.\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat dost thou say?\\nIAGO\\nNothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.\\nOTHELLO\\nWas not that Cassio parted from my wife?\\nIAGO\\nCassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,\\nThat he would steal away so guilty-like,\\nSeeing you coming.\\nOTHELLO\\nI do believe 'twas he.\\nDESDEMONA\\nHow now, my lord!\\nI have been talking with a suitor here,\\nA man that languishes in your displeasure.\\nOTHELLO\\nWho is't you mean?\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,\\nIf I have any grace or power to move you,\\nHis present reconciliation take;\\nFor if he be not one that truly loves you,\\nThat errs in ignorance and not in cunning,\\nI have no judgment in an honest face:\\nI prithee, call him back.\\nOTHELLO\\nWent he hence now?\\nDESDEMONA\\nAy, sooth; so humbled\\nThat he hath left part of his grief with me,\\nTo suffer with him. Good love, call him back.\\nOTHELLO\\nNot now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.\\nDESDEMONA\\nBut shall't be shortly?\\nOTHELLO\\nThe sooner, sweet, for you.\\nDESDEMONA\\nShall't be to-night at supper?\\nOTHELLO\\nNo, not to-night.\\nDESDEMONA\\nTo-morrow dinner, then?\\nOTHELLO\\nI shall not dine at home;\\nI meet the captains at the citadel.\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;\\nOn Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:\\nI prithee, name the time, but let it not\\nExceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;\\nAnd yet his trespass, in our common reason--\\nSave that, they say, the wars must make examples\\nOut of their best--is not almost a fault\\nTo incur a private cheque. When shall he come?\\nTell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,\\nWhat you would ask me, that I should deny,\\nOr stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,\\nThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,\\nWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly,\\nHath ta'en your part; to have so much to do\\nTo bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--\\nOTHELLO\\nPrithee, no more: let him come when he will;\\nI will deny thee nothing.\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy, this is not a boon;\\n'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\\nOr sue to you to do a peculiar profit\\nTo your own person: nay, when I have a suit\\nWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\\nIt shall be full of poise and difficult weight\\nAnd fearful to be granted.\\nOTHELLO\\nI will deny thee nothing:\\nWhereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\\nTo leave me but a little to myself.\\nDESDEMONA\\nShall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.\\nOTHELLO\\nFarewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.\\nDESDEMONA\\nEmilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;\\nWhate'er you be, I am obedient.\\nExeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nExcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,\\nBut I do love thee! and when I love thee not,\\nChaos is come again.\\nIAGO\\nMy noble lord--\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat dost thou say, Iago?\\nIAGO\\nDid Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,\\nKnow of your love?\\nOTHELLO\\nHe did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?\\nIAGO\\nBut for a satisfaction of my thought;\\nNo further harm.\\nOTHELLO\\nWhy of thy thought, Iago?\\nIAGO\\nI did not think he had been acquainted with her.\\nOTHELLO\\nO, yes; and went between us very oft.\\nIAGO\\nIndeed!\\nOTHELLO\\nIndeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?\\nIs he not honest?\\nIAGO\\nHonest, my lord!\\nOTHELLO\\nHonest! ay, honest.\\nIAGO\\nMy lord, for aught I know.\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat dost thou think?\\nIAGO\\nThink, my lord!\\nOTHELLO\\nThink, my lord!\\nBy heaven, he echoes me,\\nAs if there were some monster in his thought\\nToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:\\nI heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,\\nWhen Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?\\nAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel\\nIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'\\nAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together,\\nAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\\nSome horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,\\nShow me thy thought.\\nIAGO\\nMy lord, you know I love you.\\nOTHELLO\\nI think thou dost;\\nAnd, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,\\nAnd weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,\\nTherefore these stops of thine fright me the more:\\nFor such things in a false disloyal knave\\nAre tricks of custom, but in a man that's just\\nThey are close delations, working from the heart\\nThat passion cannot rule.\\nIAGO\\nFor Michael Cassio,\\nI dare be sworn I think that he is honest.\\nOTHELLO\\nI think so too.\\nIAGO\\nMen should be what they seem;\\nOr those that be not, would they might seem none!\\nOTHELLO\\nCertain, men should be what they seem.\\nIAGO\\nWhy, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.\\nOTHELLO\\nNay, yet there's more in this:\\nI prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,\\nAs thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts\\nThe worst of words.\\nIAGO\\nGood my lord, pardon me:\\nThough I am bound to every act of duty,\\nI am not bound to that all slaves are free to.\\nUtter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;\\nAs where's that palace whereinto foul things\\nSometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,\\nBut some uncleanly apprehensions\\nKeep leets and law-days and in session sit\\nWith meditations lawful?\\nOTHELLO\\nThou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\\nIf thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear\\nA stranger to thy thoughts.\\nIAGO\\nI do beseech you--\\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guess,\\nAs, I confess, it is my nature's plague\\nTo spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy\\nShapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,\\nFrom one that so imperfectly conceits,\\nWould take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble\\nOut of his scattering and unsure observance.\\nIt were not for your quiet nor your good,\\nNor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,\\nTo let you know my thoughts.\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat dost thou mean?\\nIAGO\\nGood name in man and woman, dear my lord,\\nIs the immediate jewel of their souls:\\nWho steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;\\n'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:\\nBut he that filches from me my good name\\nRobs me of that which not enriches him\\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\\nOTHELLO\\nBy heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.\\nIAGO\\nYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand;\\nNor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.\\nOTHELLO\\nHa!\\nIAGO\\nO, beware, my lord, of jealousy;\\nIt is the green-eyed monster which doth mock\\nThe meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss\\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\\nBut, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er\\nWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!\\nOTHELLO\\nO misery!\\nIAGO\\nPoor and content is rich and rich enough,\\nBut riches fineless is as poor as winter\\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.\\nGood heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend\\nFrom jealousy!\\nOTHELLO\\nWhy, why is this?\\nThink'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,\\nTo follow still the changes of the moon\\nWith fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt\\nIs once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,\\nWhen I shall turn the business of my soul\\nTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,\\nMatching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous\\nTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\\nIs free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;\\nWhere virtue is, these are more virtuous:\\nNor from mine own weak merits will I draw\\nThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;\\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;\\nI'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;\\nAnd on the proof, there is no more but this,--\\nAway at once with love or jealousy!\\nIAGO\\nI am glad of it; for now I shall have reason\\nTo show the love and duty that I bear you\\nWith franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,\\nReceive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.\\nLook to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;\\nWear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:\\nI would not have your free and noble nature,\\nOut of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:\\nI know our country disposition well;\\nIn Venice they do let heaven see the pranks\\nThey dare not show their husbands; their best conscience\\nIs not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.\\nOTHELLO\\nDost thou say so?\\nIAGO\\nShe did deceive her father, marrying you;\\nAnd when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,\\nShe loved them most.\\nOTHELLO\\nAnd so she did.\\nIAGO\\nWhy, go to then;\\nShe that, so young, could give out such a seeming,\\nTo seal her father's eyes up close as oak-\\nHe thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;\\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon\\nFor too much loving you.\\nOTHELLO\\nI am bound to thee for ever.\\nIAGO\\nI see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.\\nOTHELLO\\nNot a jot, not a jot.\\nIAGO\\nI' faith, I fear it has.\\nI hope you will consider what is spoke\\nComes from my love. But I do see you're moved:\\nI am to pray you not to strain my speech\\nTo grosser issues nor to larger reach\\nThan to suspicion.\\nOTHELLO\\nI will not.\\nIAGO\\nShould you do so, my lord,\\nMy speech should fall into such vile success\\nAs my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--\\nMy lord, I see you're moved.\\nOTHELLO\\nNo, not much moved:\\nI do not think but Desdemona's honest.\\nIAGO\\nLong live she so! and long live you to think so!\\nOTHELLO\\nAnd yet, how nature erring from itself,--\\nIAGO\\nAy, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--\\nNot to affect many proposed matches\\nOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,\\nWhereto we see in all things nature tends--\\nFoh! one may smell in such a will most rank,\\nFoul disproportion thoughts unnatural.\\nBut pardon me; I do not in position\\nDistinctly speak of her; though I may fear\\nHer will, recoiling to her better judgment,\\nMay fall to match you with her country forms\\nAnd happily repent.\\nOTHELLO\\nFarewell, farewell:\\nIf more thou dost perceive, let me know more;\\nSet on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:\\nIAGO\\n[Going] My lord, I take my leave.\\nOTHELLO\\nWhy did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\\nSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.\\nIAGO\\n[Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat\\nyour honour\\nTo scan this thing no further; leave it to time:\\nThough it be fit that Cassio have his place,\\nFor sure, he fills it up with great ability,\\nYet, if you please to hold him off awhile,\\nYou shall by that perceive him and his means:\\nNote, if your lady strain his entertainment\\nWith any strong or vehement importunity;\\nMuch will be seen in that. In the mean time,\\nLet me be thought too busy in my fears--\\nAs worthy cause I have to fear I am--\\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your honour.\\nOTHELLO\\nFear not my government.\\nIAGO\\nI once more take my leave.\\nExit\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nThis fellow's of exceeding honesty,\\nAnd knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,\\nOf human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,\\nThough that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,\\nI'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,\\nTo pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black\\nAnd have not those soft parts of conversation\\nThat chamberers have, or for I am declined\\nInto the vale of years,--yet that's not much--\\nShe's gone. I am abused; and my relief\\nMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,\\nThat we can call these delicate creatures ours,\\nAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,\\nAnd live upon the vapour of a dungeon,\\nThan keep a corner in the thing I love\\nFor others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;\\nPrerogatived are they less than the base;\\n'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:\\nEven then this forked plague is fated to us\\nWhen we do quicken.

Come, I'll go in with you.\\nDESDEMONA\\nI am very sorry that you are not well.\\nExeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA\\n\\nEMILIA\\nI am glad I have found this napkin:\\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor:\\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\\nWoo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,\\nFor he conjured her she should ever keep it,\\nThat she reserves it evermore about her\\nTo kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,\\nAnd give't Iago: what he will do with it\\nHeaven knows, not I;\\nI nothing but to please his fantasy.\\nRe-enter Iago\\n\\nIAGO\\nHow now! what do you here alone?\\nEMILIA\\nDo not you chide; I have a thing for you.\\nIAGO\\nA thing for me? it is a common thing--\\nEMILIA\\nHa!\\nIAGO\\nTo have a foolish wife.\\nEMILIA\\nO, is that all? What will you give me now\\nFor the same handkerchief?\\nIAGO\\nWhat handkerchief?\\nEMILIA\\nWhat handkerchief?\\nWhy, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;\\nThat which so often you did bid me steal.\\nIAGO\\nHast stol'n it from her?\\nEMILIA\\nNo, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.\\nAnd, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.\\nLook, here it is.\\nIAGO\\nA good wench; give it me.\\nEMILIA\\nWhat will you do with 't, that you have been\\nso earnest\\nTo have me filch it?\\nIAGO\\n[Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?\\nEMILIA\\nIf it be not for some purpose of import,\\nGive't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad\\nWhen she shall lack it.\\nIAGO\\nBe not acknown on 't; I have use for it.\\nGo, leave me.\\nExit EMILIA\\n\\nI will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,\\nAnd let him find it. Trifles light as air\\nAre to the jealous confirmations strong\\nAs proofs of holy writ: this may do something.\\nThe Moor already changes with my poison:\\nDangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.\\nWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste,\\nBut with a little act upon the blood.\\nBurn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:\\nLook, where he comes!\\nRe-enter OTHELLO\\n\\nNot poppy, nor mandragora,\\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\\nWhich thou owedst yesterday.\\nOTHELLO\\nHa! ha! false to me?\\nIAGO\\nWhy, how now, general! no more of that.\\nOTHELLO\\nAvaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:\\nI swear 'tis better to be much abused\\nThan but to know't a little.\\nIAGO\\nHow now, my lord!\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?\\nI saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:\\nI slept the next night well, was free and merry;\\nI found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:\\nHe that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,\\nLet him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.\\nIAGO\\nI am sorry to hear this.\\nOTHELLO\\nI had been happy, if the general camp,\\nPioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,\\nSo I had nothing known. O, now, for ever\\nFarewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!\\nFarewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,\\nThat make ambition virtue! O, farewell!\\nFarewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,\\nThe spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,\\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\\nPride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!\\nAnd, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats\\nThe immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,\\nFarewell! Othello's occupation's gone!\\nIAGO\\nIs't possible, my lord?\\nOTHELLO\\nVillain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,\\nBe sure of it; give me the ocular proof:\\nOr by the worth of man's eternal soul,\\nThou hadst been better have been born a dog\\nThan answer my waked wrath!\\nIAGO\\nIs't come to this?\\nOTHELLO\\nMake me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,\\nThat the probation bear no hinge nor loop\\nTo hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!\\nIAGO\\nMy noble lord,--\\nOTHELLO\\nIf thou dost slander her and torture me,\\nNever pray more; abandon all remorse;\\nOn horror's head horrors accumulate;\\nDo deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;\\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation add\\nGreater than that.\\nIAGO\\nO grace! O heaven forgive me!\\nAre you a man? have you a soul or sense?\\nGod be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.\\nThat livest to make thine honesty a vice!\\nO monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,\\nTo be direct and honest is not safe.\\nI thank you for this profit; and from hence\\nI'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.\\nOTHELLO\\nNay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.\\nIAGO\\nI should be wise, for honesty's a fool\\nAnd loses that it works for.\\nOTHELLO\\nBy the world,\\nI think my wife be honest and think she is not;\\nI think that thou art just and think thou art not.\\nI'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh\\nAs Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black\\nAs mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,\\nPoison, or fire, or suffocating streams,\\nI'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!\\nIAGO\\nI see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:\\nI do repent me that I put it to you.\\nYou would be satisfied?\\nOTHELLO\\nWould! nay, I will.\\nIAGO\\nAnd may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?\\nWould you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--\\nBehold her topp'd?\\nOTHELLO\\nDeath and damnation! O!\\nIAGO\\nIt were a tedious difficulty, I think,\\nTo bring them to that prospect: damn them then,\\nIf ever mortal eyes do see them bolster\\nMore than their own! What then? how then?\\nWhat shall I say? Where's satisfaction?\\nIt is impossible you should see this,\\nWere they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\\nAs salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross\\nAs ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,\\nIf imputation and strong circumstances,\\nWhich lead directly to the door of truth,\\nWill give you satisfaction, you may have't.\\nOTHELLO\\nGive me a living reason she's disloyal.\\nIAGO\\nI do not like the office:\\nBut, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,\\nPrick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,\\nI will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;\\nAnd, being troubled with a raging tooth,\\nI could not sleep.\\nThere are a kind of men so loose of soul,\\nThat in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:\\nOne of this kind is Cassio:\\nIn sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,\\nLet us be wary, let us hide our loves;'\\nAnd then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,\\nCry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,\\nAs if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots\\nThat grew upon my lips: then laid his leg\\nOver my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then\\nCried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'\\nOTHELLO\\nO monstrous! monstrous!\\nIAGO\\nNay, this was but his dream.\\nOTHELLO\\nBut this denoted a foregone conclusion:\\n'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.\\nIAGO\\nAnd this may help to thicken other proofs\\nThat do demonstrate thinly.\\nOTHELLO\\nI'll tear her all to pieces.\\nIAGO\\nNay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;\\nShe may be honest yet. Tell me but this,\\nHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief\\nSpotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?\\nOTHELLO\\nI gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.\\nIAGO\\nI know not that; but such a handkerchief--\\nI am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day\\nSee Cassio wipe his beard with.\\nOTHELLO\\nIf it be that--\\nIAGO\\nIf it be that, or any that was hers,\\nIt speaks against her with the other proofs.\\nOTHELLO\\nO, that the slave had forty thousand lives!\\nOne is too poor, too weak for my revenge.\\nNow do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;\\nAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.\\n'Tis gone.\\nArise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!\\nYield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne\\nTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,\\nFor 'tis of aspics' tongues!\\nIAGO\\nYet be content.\\nOTHELLO\\nO, blood, blood, blood!\\nIAGO\\nPatience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.\\nOTHELLO\\nNever, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,\\nWhose icy current and compulsive course\\nNe'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\\nTo the Propontic and the Hellespont,\\nEven so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,\\nShall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,\\nTill that a capable and wide revenge\\nSwallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,\\nKneels\\n\\nIn the due reverence of a sacred vow\\nI here engage my words.\\nIAGO\\nDo not rise yet.\\nKneels\\n\\nWitness, you ever-burning lights above,\\nYou elements that clip us round about,\\nWitness that here Iago doth give up\\nThe execution of his wit, hands, heart,\\nTo wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,\\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse,\\nWhat bloody business ever.\\nThey rise\\n\\nOTHELLO\\nI greet thy love,\\nNot with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,\\nAnd will upon the instant put thee to't:\\nWithin these three days let me hear thee say\\nThat Cassio's not alive.\\nIAGO\\nMy friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:\\nBut let her live.\\nOTHELLO\\nDamn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!\\nCome, go with me apart; I will withdraw,\\nTo furnish me with some swift means of death\\nFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.\\nIAGO\\nI am your own for ever.\\nExeunt\\n\\nSCENE IV.

'Tis a good hand,\\nA frank one.\\nDESDEMONA\\nYou may, indeed, say so;\\nFor 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.\\nOTHELLO\\nA liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;\\nBut our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\\nDESDEMONA\\nI cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.\\nOTHELLO\\nWhat promise, chuck?\\nDESDEMONA\\nI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.\\nOTHELLO\\nI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;\\nLend me thy handkerchief.\\nDESDEMONA\\nHere, my lord.\\nOTHELLO\\nThat which I gave you.\\nDESDEMONA\\nI have it not about me.\\nOTHELLO\\nNot?\\nDESDEMONA\\nNo, indeed, my lord.\\nOTHELLO\\nThat is a fault.\\nThat handkerchief\\nDid an Egyptian to my mother give;\\nShe was a charmer, and could almost read\\nThe thoughts of people: she told her, while\\nshe kept it,\\n'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father\\nEntirely to her love, but if she lost it\\nOr made gift of it, my father's eye\\nShould hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt\\nAfter new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;\\nAnd bid me, when my fate would have me wive,\\nTo give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;\\nMake it a darling like your precious eye;\\nTo lose't or give't away were such perdition\\nAs nothing else could match.\\nDESDEMONA\\nIs't possible?\\nOTHELLO\\n'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:\\nA sibyl, that had number'd in the world\\nThe sun to course two hundred compasses,\\nIn her prophetic fury sew'd the work;\\nThe worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;\\nAnd it was dyed in mummy which the skilful\\nConserved of maidens' hearts.\\nDESDEMONA\\nIndeed! is't true?\\nOTHELLO\\nMost veritable; therefore look to't well.\\nDESDEMONA\\nThen would to God that I had never seen't!\\nOTHELLO\\nHa! wherefore?\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy do you speak so startingly and rash?\\nOTHELLO\\nIs't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out\\no' the way?\\nDESDEMONA\\nHeaven bless us!\\nOTHELLO\\nSay you?\\nDESDEMONA\\nIt is not lost; but what an if it were?\\nOTHELLO\\nHow!\\nDESDEMONA\\nI say, it is not lost.\\nOTHELLO\\nFetch't, let me see't.\\nDESDEMONA\\nWhy, so I can, sir, but I will not now.\\nThis is a trick to put me from my suit:\\nPray you, let Cassio be received again.\\nOTHELLO\\nFetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.\\nDESDEMONA\\nCome, come;\\nYou'll never meet a more sufficient man.\\nOTHELLO\\nThe handkerchief!\\nDESDEMONA\\nI pray, talk me of Cassio.\\nOTHELLO\\nThe handkerchief!\\nDESDEMONA\\nA man that all his time\\nHath founded his good fortunes on your love,\\nShared dangers with you,--\\nOTHELLO\\nThe handkerchief!\\nDESDEMONA\\nIn sooth, you are to blame.\\nOTHELLO\\nAway!\\nExit\\n\\nEMILIA\\nIs not this man jealous?\\nDESDEMONA\\nI ne'er saw this before.\\nSure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:\\nI am most unhappy in the loss of it.\\nEMILIA\\n'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:\\nThey are all but stomachs, and we all but food;\\nTo eat us hungerly, and when they are full,\\nThey belch us.

Here he comes:\\nRe-enter CASSIO\\n\\nAs he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;\\nAnd his unbookish jealousy must construe\\nPoor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,\\nQuite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?\\nCASSIO\\nThe worser that you give me the addition\\nWhose want even kills me.\\nIAGO\\nPly Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.\\nSpeaking lower\\n\\nNow, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,\\nHow quickly should you speed!\\nCASSIO\\nAlas, poor caitiff!\\nOTHELLO\\nLook, how he laughs already!\\nIAGO\\nI never knew woman love man so.\\nCASSIO\\nAlas, poor rogue!

O,\\nI see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall\\nthrow it to.\\nCASSIO\\nWell, I must leave her company.\\nIAGO\\nBefore me! look, where she comes.\\nCASSIO\\n'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.\\nEnter BIANCA\\n\\nWhat do you mean by this haunting of me?\\nBIANCA\\nLet the devil and his dam haunt you!

I do but say what she is: so delicate\\nwith her needle: an admirable musician: O! she\\nwill sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high\\nand plenteous wit and invention:--\\nIAGO\\nShe's the worse for all this.\\nOTHELLO\\nO, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so\\ngentle a condition!\\nIAGO\\nAy, too gentle.\\nOTHELLO\\nNay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!\\nO Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\\nIAGO\\nIf you are so fond over her iniquity, give her\\npatent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes\\nnear nobody.\\nOTHELLO\\nI will chop her into messes: cuckold me!\\nIAGO\\nO, 'tis foul in her.\\nOTHELLO\\nWith mine officer!\\nIAGO\\nThat's fouler.\\nOTHELLO\\nGet me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not\\nexpostulate with her, lest her body and beauty\\nunprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.\\nIAGO\\nDo it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even\\nthe bed she hath contaminated.\\nOTHELLO\\nGood, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.\\nIAGO\\nAnd for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you\\nshall hear more by midnight.\\nOTHELLO\\nExcellent good.\\nA trumpet within\\n\\nWhat trumpet is that same?\\nIAGO\\nSomething from Venice, sure.

I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis\\nnot very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin\\nto find myself fobbed in it.\\nIAGO\\nVery well.\\nRODERIGO\\nI tell you 'tis not very well.

Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast\\ntaken against me a most just exception; but yet, I\\nprotest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.\\nRODERIGO\\nIt hath not appeared.\\nIAGO\\nI grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your\\nsuspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,\\nRoderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I\\nhave greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean\\npurpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if\\nthou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,\\ntake me from this world with treachery and devise\\nengines for my life.\\nRODERIGO\\nWell, what is it? is it within reason and compass?\\nIAGO\\nSir, there is especial commission come from Venice\\nto depute Cassio in Othello's place.\\nRODERIGO\\nIs that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona\\nreturn again to Venice.\\nIAGO\\nO, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with\\nhim the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be\\nlingered here by some accident: wherein none can be\\nso determinate as the removing of Cassio.\\nRODERIGO\\nHow do you mean, removing of him?\\nIAGO\\nWhy, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;\\nknocking out his brains.\\nRODERIGO\\nAnd that you would have me to do?\\nIAGO\\nAy, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.\\nHe sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I\\ngo to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable\\nfortune. If you will watch his going thence, which\\nI will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,\\nyou may take him at your pleasure: I will be near\\nto second your attempt, and he shall fall between\\nus. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with\\nme; I will show you such a necessity in his death\\nthat you shall think yourself bound to put it on\\nhim.

Let husbands know\\nTheir wives have sense like them: they see and smell\\nAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,\\nAs husbands have. What is it that they do\\nWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?\\nI think it is: and doth affection breed it?\\nI think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?\\nIt is so too: and have not we affections,\\nDesires for sport, and frailty, as men have?\\nThen let them use us well: else let them know,\\nThe ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\\nDESDEMONA\\nGood night, good night: heaven me such uses send,\\nNot to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!\\nExeunt\\n\\nACT V\\nSCENE I.

MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nWhere is this rash and most unfortunate man?\\nOTHELLO\\nThat's he that was Othello: here I am.\\nLODOVICO\\nWhere is that viper? bring the villain forth.\\nOTHELLO\\nI look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.\\nIf that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.\\nWounds IAGO\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nWrench his sword from him.\\nIAGO\\nI bleed, sir; but not kill'd.\\nOTHELLO\\nI am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;\\nFor, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.\\nLODOVICO\\nO thou Othello, thou wert once so good,\\nFall'n in the practise of a damned slave,\\nWhat shall be said to thee?\\nOTHELLO\\nWhy, any thing:\\nAn honourable murderer, if you will;\\nFor nought I did in hate, but all in honour.\\nLODOVICO\\nThis wretch hath part confess'd his villany:\\nDid you and he consent in Cassio's death?\\nOTHELLO\\nAy.\\nCASSIO\\nDear general, I never gave you cause.\\nOTHELLO\\nI do believe it, and I ask your pardon.\\nWill you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\\nWhy he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?\\nIAGO\\nDemand me nothing: what you know, you know:\\nFrom this time forth I never will speak word.\\nLODOVICO\\nWhat, not to pray?\\nGRATIANO\\nTorments will ope your lips.\\nOTHELLO\\nWell, thou dost best.\\nLODOVICO\\nSir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,\\nWhich, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter\\nFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;\\nAnd here another: the one of them imports\\nThe death of Cassio to be undertook\\nBy Roderigo.\\nOTHELLO\\nO villain!\\nCASSIO\\nMost heathenish and most gross!\\nLODOVICO\\nNow here's another discontented paper,\\nFound in his pocket too; and this, it seems,\\nRoderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;\\nBut that belike Iago in the interim\\nCame in and satisfied him.\\nOTHELLO\\nO the pernicious caitiff!\\nHow came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief\\nThat was my wife's?\\nCASSIO\\nI found it in my chamber:\\nAnd he himself confess'd but even now\\nThat there he dropp'd it for a special purpose\\nWhich wrought to his desire.\\nOTHELLO\\nO fool! fool! fool!\\nCASSIO\\nThere is besides in Roderigo's letter,\\nHow he upbraids Iago, that he made him\\nBrave me upon the watch; whereon it came\\nThat I was cast: and even but now he spake,\\nAfter long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,\\nIago set him on.\\nLODOVICO\\nYou must forsake this room, and go with us:\\nYour power and your command is taken off,\\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,\\nIf there be any cunning cruelty\\nThat can torment him much and hold him long,\\nIt shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,\\nTill that the nature of your fault be known\\nTo the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.\\nOTHELLO\\nSoft you; a word or two before you go.\\nI have done the state some service, and they know't.\\nNo more of that. I pray you, in your letters,\\nWhen you shall these unlucky deeds relate,\\nSpeak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,\\nNor set down aught in malice: then must you speak\\nOf one that loved not wisely but too well;\\nOf one not easily jealous, but being wrought\\nPerplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,\\nLike the base Indian, threw a pearl away\\nRicher than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,\\nAlbeit unused to the melting mood,\\nDrop tears as fast as the Arabian trees\\nTheir medicinal gum. Set you down this;\\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\\nWhere a malignant and a turban'd Turk\\nBeat a Venetian and traduced the state,\\nI took by the throat the circumcised dog,\\nAnd smote him, thus.\\nStabs himself\\n\\nLODOVICO\\nO bloody period!\\nGRATIANO\\nAll that's spoke is marr'd.\\nOTHELLO\\nI kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;\\nKilling myself, to die upon a kiss.\\nFalls on the bed, and dies\\n\\nCASSIO\\nThis did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;\\nFor he was great of heart.\\nLODOVICO\\n[To IAGO] O Spartan dog,\\nMore fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!\\nLook on the tragic loading of this bed;\\nThis is thy work: the object poisons sight;\\nLet it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,\\nAnd seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\\nFor they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,\\nRemains the censure of this hellish villain;\\nThe time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!\\nMyself will straight aboard: and to the state\\nThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.\\nExeunt\\n\""
